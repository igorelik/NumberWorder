This is a simple text manipulation program - it takes set of numbers as an input and produces these numbers in a text format.

The rules are:
More than a single number is allowed per input
Multiple numbers can be separated by any non-numerical character.

As a result word representation of all numbers is printed one number per line.
Example: 123 -> onetwothree

Your task?  To get it working :-)
[Extra credit - convert numbers to proper wording, e.g. 123 -> one hundreed twenty three]
